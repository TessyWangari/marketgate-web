  <h1 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 5%">What is ChapChap SQL made of & what can it do for you.</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you have been using PHP to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to your database, you've probably been writing a lot of code.<br> Whether you're a newbie to or a novice at PHP, you are most likely familiar with how much code is needed in order to connect to a database,<br> perform a simple operation such as reading data from a table, or log errors for debugging. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With MarketGate, you can make your coding much easier by writing less code: <br>you don't need to worry if you've used prepared statements each time you make a CRUD operation,<br> if you've escaped the data to prevent a security breach, or if you've used the correct SQL syntax. <br>All this is handled for you so that you can concentrate on your project with your mind at ease, assured that issues such as SQL injection are already taken care of. </p><br><br>
